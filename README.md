# Rocket-Add
An Example API called [Rocket-Add](https://github.com/c-ameron/rocket-add) which built on top of [Rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/)

This application extends the 'Hello World' example with a new api call `add/<num1>/<num2>` which adds two numbers and outputs the result.
